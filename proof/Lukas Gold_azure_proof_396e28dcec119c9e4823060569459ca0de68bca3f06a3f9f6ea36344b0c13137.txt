My purpose is to help you work more effectively with your electronic lab notebook (ELN).

You can use me to:
- Design and document experiments (methods, parameters, templates)
- Organize and search notes, samples, and results
- Structure data entry (tables, metadata, versioning)
- Interpret and summarize experimental results you paste in
- Help with SOPs, protocols, and compliance-focused documentation
- Improve clarity and reproducibility of your ELN records

In short: I’m here to make your ELN usage more organized, consistent, and efficient.
